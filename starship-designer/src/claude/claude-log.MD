\#claude instructions

Start using the new procedure as described in src/claude/claude.MD to make changes, so this one will be the claude-log feature, using the feature/claude-log branch. Make the described process simpler to use by saving the process for this project, and offer a simpler format that makes sense like "Apply the claude/src/feature-name.MD work" to the user

## Feature Implementation Log - 2025-08-05

### Task: Implement Simplified Claude Process

**Branch:** feature/claude-logs

**Actions Completed:**

1. **Branch Management**
   - Successfully switched to feature/claude-logs branch

2. **Simplified Process Implementation**
   - Created `apply-feature.js` script to automate command generation
   - Script takes feature name as parameter and generates proper Claude command
   - Includes error handling for missing feature files
   - Lists available feature files when target file doesn't exist

3. **Documentation**
   - Created `README.md` in src/claude/ directory
   - Documents the simplified workflow with examples
   - Provides quick start guide for users
   - Explains the relationship to the original process in claude.MD

**Files Created:**
- `src/claude/apply-feature.js` - Node.js script for command generation
- `src/claude/README.md` - Documentation for simplified process

**Result:**
Users can now simply run `node src/claude/apply-feature.js <feature-name>` to generate the proper Claude command, making the process much more user-friendly and reducing the chance of command formatting errors.

**Next Steps:**
Ready for testing and potential PR creation once verified working correctly.

## Follow-up Actions - 2025-08-05

### Missing Draft PR Creation

**Issue Identified:** Initial implementation missed creating the Draft PR as specified in claude.MD instructions.

**Actions Taken:**

1. **Draft PR Creation Process**
   - Branch was already pushed to origin/feature/claude-logs
   - GitHub provided PR creation link: https://github.com/DavidLDawes/aid/pull/new/feature/claude-logs
   - `gh` CLI tool not available in environment, so manual PR creation required

2. **Script Enhancement**
   - Updated `apply-feature.js` to include Draft PR creation instructions
   - Added step-by-step guidance for post-completion actions
   - Included both `gh` CLI command and manual GitHub link options

3. **Process Improvement**
   - Script now provides complete workflow guidance including PR creation
   - Users get clear instructions for both Claude commands and follow-up actions

**Files Modified:**
- `src/claude/apply-feature.js` - Added PR creation guidance

**Status:**
Feature branch pushed, PR creation instructions added to script. Manual PR creation required due to `gh` CLI unavailability.
