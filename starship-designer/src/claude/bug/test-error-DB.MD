#claude instructions
Use the procedure described in src/claude/claude.MD to make changes, so this one will be the test-error bug, using the bug/test-error branch.

When npm runs tests in a CI/CD pipeline I get the following errors:

1. TypeScript compilation error:
Error: src/services/flushDB.test.ts(26,25): error TS2341: Property 'db' is private and only accessible within class 'DatabaseService'.

2. Test execution failures in applyFeature.test.ts:
   × Apply Feature Script > Integration with existing files > should successfully process npm-flush-db.MD
     → expected '\n> starship-designer@0.0.0 apply-fea…' to contain 'Path validated: process\npm-flush-db.…'
   × Apply Feature Script > Integration with existing files > should successfully process npm-apply-feature.MD
     → expected '\n> starship-designer@0.0.0 apply-fea…' to contain 'Path validated: process\npm-apply-fea…'

The test failures seem to be related to npm output formatting differences between local and CI/CD environments. The tests are looking for specific strings in the console output, but CI/CD environments may have different npm output formatting.

Take a look at figuring out why these occur, when they seem to run fine locally.

## Analysis and Investigation

Investigated the CI/CD test failures by examining the affected files:
- `src/services/flushDB.test.ts` - TypeScript compilation error due to accessing private `db` property
- `src/services/applyFeature.test.ts` - Test failures due to npm output format differences between local and CI/CD environments

## Issue 1: TypeScript Compilation Error

**Problem**: `src/services/flushDB.test.ts(26,25): error TS2341: Property 'db' is private and only accessible within class 'DatabaseService'`

**Root Cause**: Test code was directly accessing the private `db` property of DatabaseService for cleanup operations, violating TypeScript's access control.

**Solution**: Added a public `flushAllShips()` method to `src/services/database.ts:255-266` to provide controlled database cleanup:

```typescript
async flushAllShips(): Promise<void> {
  if (!this.db) throw new Error('Database not initialized');
  
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const transaction = this.db!.transaction(['ships'], 'readwrite');
    const store = transaction.objectStore('ships');
    const request = store.clear();
    
    request.onerror = () => reject(request.error);
    request.onsuccess = () => resolve();
  });
}
```

**Fixed**: Updated `src/services/flushDB.test.ts:26` to use `await databaseService.flushAllShips();` instead of private property access.

## Issue 2: CI/CD Test Format Differences

**Problem**: Integration tests in `src/services/applyFeature.test.ts:130,143` failed because they expected exact string matches for npm output, but CI/CD environments format npm output differently than local environments.

**Root Cause**: Tests used `.toContain()` with exact strings like `'Path validated: process\\npm-flush-db.MD'`, but CI/CD npm output includes additional formatting and prefixes.

**Solution**: Replaced exact string matching with flexible regex patterns in `src/services/applyFeature.test.ts:130,143`:

```typescript
// Before: expect(result).toContain('Path validated: process\\npm-flush-db.MD');
// After: expect(result).toMatch(/Path validated:.*npm-flush-db\.MD/);

// Before: expect(result).toContain('Path validated: process\\npm-apply-feature.MD');  
// After: expect(result).toMatch(/Path validated:.*npm-apply-feature\.MD/);
```

## Additional Fixes

**TypeScript Dependencies**: Added `@types/node` to `package.json:27` to resolve Node.js API type definitions for execSync and file system operations.

**Code Cleanup**: Removed unused variables `ship1Id` and `ship2Id` from `src/services/flushDB.test.ts:33-34` to eliminate TypeScript warnings.

## Verification

- All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
- All 100 tests now pass successfully  
- Build process completes without errors
- Integration tests work with both local and CI/CD npm output formats

**Status**: ✅ Complete - Both CI/CD pipeline errors have been successfully resolved with proper encapsulation and flexible test assertions.

## Final Status

All bug fixes have been implemented and verified. Claude is now preparing the PR for final review and merge. Stopping logging as instructed for the final GitHub push and PR preparation.
