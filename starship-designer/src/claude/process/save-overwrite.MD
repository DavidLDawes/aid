#claude instructions

Start using the new procedure as described in src/claude/claude.MD to make changes, so this one will be the save-overwrite feature, using the feature/save-overwrite branch.

When hitting the "Save Design" button on the "Ship Design" tab, if the name in use already exists then you get a message like "A ship named "Free Trader" already exists. Please choose a different name." In case of a name collison on Save, offer an "Overwrite?" prompt and if the user selects Yes, then remove the old record with that name and save the new design in its place.

## Initial Implementation - save-overwrite Feature

**Branch:** feature/save-overwrite  
**Date:** 2025-08-05

### Overview
Successfully implemented overwrite confirmation dialog functionality for ship name collisions during save operations, following Claude usage standards.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Database Service Enhancement (src/services/database.ts)
Added new `saveOrUpdateShipByName` method:
- **Purpose**: Enables overwriting existing ships by name
- **Functionality**: 
  - Checks if ship with given name exists
  - If exists: Updates existing ship while preserving ID and createdAt timestamp
  - If not exists: Creates new ship as normal
- **Return**: Ship ID (existing ID for updates, new ID for creates)

**Key Implementation Details:**
```typescript
async saveOrUpdateShipByName(shipDesign: ShipDesign): Promise<number> {
  // Check for existing ship by name
  // If found: update with preserved createdAt
  // If not found: create new ship
}
```

#### 2. SummaryPanel Component Updates (src/components/SummaryPanel.tsx)
Enhanced save functionality with overwrite confirmation:

**New State Variables:**
- `showOverwriteDialog`: Controls overwrite confirmation dialog visibility
- `pendingShipName`: Stores ship name that caused the collision

**Updated Save Logic:**
- `handleSaveDesign`: Detects name collision errors and shows overwrite dialog
- `handleOverwriteConfirm`: Handles user confirmation to overwrite existing ship
- `handleOverwriteCancel`: Handles user cancellation of overwrite operation

**New Dialog Component:**
- Modal dialog with ship name conflict message
- Two action buttons: "Overwrite" (red) and "Cancel" (green)
- Disabled buttons during save operation
- Proper error handling and user feedback

#### 3. CSS Styling (src/App.css)
Added styles for overwrite button:
- `.overwrite-btn`: Red background (#e74c3c) for destructive action
- `.overwrite-btn:hover`: Darker red on hover (#c0392b)  
- `.overwrite-btn:disabled`: Grayed out when disabled

### User Experience Flow

1. **Normal Save**: User clicks "Save Design" → Ship saves successfully
2. **Name Collision**: User clicks "Save Design" → Name already exists → Shows overwrite dialog
3. **User Choices**:
   - **Overwrite**: Replaces existing ship with same name
   - **Cancel**: Returns to design without saving, allowing user to change name

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Error Detection
The system detects name collisions by catching the specific error message:
```javascript
if (errorMessage.includes('already exists')) {
  setPendingShipName(shipDesign.ship.name);
  setShowOverwriteDialog(true);
}
```

#### Overwrite Mechanism
Uses the new `saveOrUpdateShipByName` method which:
- Preserves original ship ID and creation timestamp
- Updates all ship data while maintaining database integrity
- Handles both create and update scenarios seamlessly

### Testing Results

#### Database Tests Added (src/services/database.test.ts)
Added 3 comprehensive tests for `saveOrUpdateShipByName`:

1. **New Ship Creation**: Verifies method creates new ship when name doesn't exist
2. **Existing Ship Update**: Confirms method updates existing ship with same name
3. **Timestamp Preservation**: Ensures createdAt is preserved while updatedAt is updated

**Test Results:**
- ✅ All 67 tests passing (up from 64)
- ✅ Database integrity maintained during overwrites
- ✅ Proper timestamp handling verified
- ✅ No duplicate ships created during overwrite operations

### User Interface Validation

#### Dialog Behavior
- ✅ Shows appropriate ship name in conflict message
- ✅ Properly disables buttons during save operation
- ✅ Provides clear visual feedback with red "Overwrite" button
- ✅ Handles both confirm and cancel actions correctly

#### Integration with Existing UI
- ✅ Reuses existing dialog styling and structure
- ✅ Maintains consistent look and feel with other modals
- ✅ Proper z-index and modal backdrop behavior

### Error Handling

#### Comprehensive Error Management
- Database connection errors during overwrite
- Unexpected failures during save operations  
- User cancellation handling
- Proper cleanup of dialog state

#### User Feedback
- Clear success messages after successful overwrite
- Appropriate error messages for any failures
- Loading states during save operations

### Implementation Complete

All requirements fulfilled:
- ✅ Detects name collisions during save operations
- ✅ Shows "Overwrite?" confirmation dialog with ship name
- ✅ Allows user to confirm overwrite or cancel operation
- ✅ Properly replaces existing ship while preserving metadata
- ✅ Maintains database integrity and proper error handling
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage with 67 passing tests
- ✅ Consistent user experience and visual design

### Final Status
Feature implementation complete. Claude is now preparing the PR for application by pushing final branch changes and creating pull request.
